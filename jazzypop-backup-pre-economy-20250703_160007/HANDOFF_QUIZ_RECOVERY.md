# JazzyPop Quiz System Recovery - Session Handoff

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. AWS Storage Expansion âœ…
- Expanded disk from 8GB to 24GB
- Fixed partition and filesystem to use new space
- Disk usage reduced from 95% to 25%

### 2. Database Cleanup âœ…
- Removed 755 placeholder quiz sets with "Option A/B/C/D"
- Removed 505 duplicate quiz sets
- Total: 1,260 junk entries cleaned
- Now have 1,410 high-quality quiz sets

### 3. Quiz Generator Mystery Solved âœ…
- Original generator was lost during Redis removal (July 2)
- Created new `quiz_set_generator.py` that:
  - Generates sets of 10 creative questions
  - Creates all mode variations (chaos/zen/speed)
  - Uses same AI prompts as original
  - Runs every 5 minutes as service

### 4. New API Endpoints Created
- `/api/content/quiz/sets` - Get multiple quiz sets with filters
  - Filter by category, mode, count
  - Order by newest/random
- `/api/content/quiz/categories` - List available categories
- `/api/content/quiz/stats` - Get quiz statistics

### 5. Services Fixed
- Stopped old single-question generator
- Fixed Python virtual environment issues
- Installed missing dependencies (aiohttp, redis)
- Created systemd service for quiz generator
- Monitor and crash recovery scripts updated

## Current Status

### Running Services:
- `jazzypop-api` - API server âœ…
- `jazzypop-quiz-generator` - New quiz set generator âœ…
- `jazzypop-generators` - Content generators âœ…
- `jazzypop-monitor` - System monitor (needs Redis fix)

### Quiz Generation:
- Generating new quiz sets every 5 minutes
- 1,412+ quiz sets in database
- All with proper mode variations

## Pending Tasks

1. **Fix Monitor Service**
   - Remove Redis checks from system_monitor.py
   - Line 142: Remove `status["redis"] = ...`
   - Deploy fixed version

2. **Deploy New API Endpoints**
   - Copy api_quiz_endpoints.py content to main.py
   - Restart API service

3. **Implement Radio Rotation**
   - Track quiz usage/plays
   - Weight newer content higher
   - Only generate when needed

## Key Files Created/Modified

- `/backend/quiz_set_generator.py` - New quiz generator
- `/backend/api_quiz_endpoints.py` - New API endpoints
- `/backend/crash_recovery.py` - Auto-recovery script
- `/backend/jazzypop-quiz-generator.service` - Systemd service

## Important Discovery

The quiz generation system was tied to Redis and broke when Redis was removed. We've rebuilt it better without the wasteful expiration system.

Good luck with the next session! ðŸš€
