## Validation Process Overview

### Triple Validation System

Each quiz goes through three AI-powered validation passes:

#### Pass 1: Feedback Generation & Enhancement
- Generates engaging feedback captions for correct/incorrect answers
- Evaluates difficulty (1-5 scale)
- Adds relevant topic tags
- Initial quality assessment

#### Pass 2: Fact Checking & Verification
- Verifies the correct answer is factually accurate
- Ensures wrong answers are definitively incorrect
- Cross-checks difficulty rating
- Identifies potential issues (ambiguity, outdated info, etc.)

#### Pass 3: Quality Control & Final Decision
- Scores based on 7 quality criteria
- Makes final approval/revision/rejection decision
- Generates admin alerts for severe issues
- Assigns final quality score (0.0-1.0)

### Quality Criteria
1. âœ“ Correct answer is 100% accurate
2. âœ“ Wrong answers are clearly incorrect
3. âœ“ Question is clear and unambiguous
4. âœ“ Content is appropriate and current
5. âœ“ Difficulty rating is consistent
6. âœ“ Educational value exists
7. âœ“ Entertaining/engaging element present

### Scoring Rules
- 6-7 points = **APPROVED**
- 4-5 points = **NEEDS REVISION** (specific fixes required)
- 0-3 points = **REJECTED**

For quiz sets: If < 5/10 questions pass, the entire set is rejected.

## Validation Worker

The validation system includes a background worker that automatically processes pending quiz sets:

- Processes in batches (configurable via `VALIDATION_BATCH_SIZE`)
- Runs on intervals (configurable via `VALIDATION_INTERVAL`)
- Sends admin alerts via Discord webhook for critical issues
- Tracks comprehensive statistics

### Running the Worker
```bash
# Start the validation worker
python validation_worker.py

# Process existing content
python validate_existing_content.py --batch-size 20 --delay 3

# Dry run to see what would be validated
python validate_existing_content.py --dry-run
```
