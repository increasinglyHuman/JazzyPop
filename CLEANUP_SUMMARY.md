# JazzyPop Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed System Monitor Crashes
- **Problem**: Monitor was crashing every 60 seconds due to missing "process" keys
- **Solution**: Updated to use systemd service names and added `check_systemd_service()` method
- **Result**: Monitor now stable and reporting correctly

### 2. Removed Individual Quiz Items
- **Deleted**: 31 obsolete individual quiz items from database (soft delete)
- **Updated**: System monitor to no longer report individual items
- **Result**: Database now only contains quiz sets (as intended)

### 3. Optimized Quiz Loading
- **Problem**: QuizModal was ignoring quiz ID and fetching random quiz
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified QuizModal to accept full quiz data (`loadQuizData()` method)
  - Updated CardManager to store and pass full quiz data
  - No more unnecessary API calls
- **Result**: Quiz loads instantly with the correct data

### 4. Architecture Clarifications
- **Quiz endpoints**: 
  - Primary: `/api/content/quiz/sets` (returns arrays of 10-question sets)
  - Secondary: `/api/content/quiz/current` (returns random quiz)
- **Removed need for**: `/api/content/quiz/{id}` endpoint
- **Cards system**: Should be deprecated (promotional cards no longer needed)

## Deployment Status

### Backend (Deployed ✅)
- Fixed database.py (Redis-free version)
- Fixed system_monitor.py (no crashes, no individual items)
- Cleaned up database (removed 31 individual items)

### Frontend (Not Yet Deployed ❌)
- Updated QuizModal.js (accepts quiz data directly)
- Updated CardManager.js (passes full quiz data)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy frontend changes** to server
2. **Remove promotional cards system** completely
3. **Clean up code** that references individual quiz items
4. **Update documentation** to reflect new architecture

## Benefits
- **Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary API call when opening quiz
- **Reliability**: Quiz shows exactly what was clicked (not random)
- **Simplicity**: Cleaner architecture without individual items or promo cards
- **Monitoring**: Stable Discord reporting without crashes
