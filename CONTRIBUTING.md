# Contributing to JazzyPop 

We love your input! We want to make contributing to JazzyPop as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code follows the existing style
5. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- **JavaScript**: ES6+, async/await preferred
- **CSS**: Mobile-first, BEM-like naming for components
- **No external UI frameworks**: Keep it vanilla for ALM compatibility

## Design Guidelines

- **Emojis**: Use sparingly and meaningfully
- **Typography**: Large, readable fonts (min 16px)
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44x44px

## Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally

## Testing

npm test
```
