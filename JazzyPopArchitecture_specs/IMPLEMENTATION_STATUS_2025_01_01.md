# Implementation Status - January 1, 2025

## Today's Accomplishments

### âœ… Custom Alert Modal System
- Created `AlertModal.js` component to replace browser `alert()` calls
- Supports alert and confirm dialogs with custom icons
- Integrated throughout the application
- Added "Army of Claude Bobs" credits with Brutalist Bob Manifesto references

### âœ… Economy System Foundation
- Implemented secure `EconomyManager.js` with anti-tampering features
- Features:
  - Transaction validation and rate limiting
  - Checksum verification every 5 seconds
  - Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
  - Mock server API for testing
- Resources: Energy (100), Hearts (5), Gems (20), Crystals (100), Shards (500), XP, Level
- Added energy and gems to stats bar UI

### âœ… Google Sign-In Integration
- Successfully integrated Google OAuth 2.0
- Client ID: 482342615637-jfht0gsdc4lm58fe8b3v6t60pg7lubhe.apps.googleusercontent.com
- Configured authorized origins for localhost and p0qp0q.com
- Bot avatars now persist over Google profile pictures

### âœ… Avatar Selection Fix
- Fixed avatar click events not registering
- Issue was `touch-action: pan-x` CSS preventing taps
- Changed to `touch-action: manipulation` for both pan and tap
- Avatar selection now persists across sessions

### âœ… UI Improvements
- Fixed red background overlay on wrong quiz answers
- Added XP progress bar under user level (9px font, 150px width)
- Removed broken heart overlay animation
- Added pointer-events fixes for avatar selection

## Partially Implemented

### ðŸŸ¡ Economy Integration
- EconomyManager created but not yet integrated with QuizModal
- Strike system designed (3 strikes = 1 heart) but not implemented
- Energy costs for activities planned but not enforced

### ðŸŸ¡ Backend Integration
- Currently using localStorage for user data
- Need to migrate to server-side storage for multi-user support
- API endpoints for economy transactions not yet created

## Updated Task Status

From JAZZYPOP_TASK_LIST.md:
- Task #4: Replace System Alerts - âœ… COMPLETE
- Task #8: Fix Google Sign-In - âœ… COMPLETE  
- Task #10: Fix Profile System - âœ… COMPLETE (avatar persistence)
- Task #11: Herding Game - DEFERRED
- Task #14: Balance Heart/Lives Economy - ðŸŸ¡ PARTIAL (EconomyManager created)
- Task #15: Varied Failure Penalties - ðŸŸ¡ PARTIAL (system designed)
- Task #16: XP & Leveling System - ðŸŸ¡ PARTIAL (UI added, needs backend)

## Architecture Decisions

### Security-First Economy
- All economy calculations happen server-side (or will when backend connected)
- Client maintains optimistic UI state but server is source of truth
- Anti-tampering checks prevent localStorage manipulation
- Rate limiting prevents rapid-fire requests

### Component Communication
- EconomyManager acts as central store for all economy data
- Components request changes through validated transactions
- Event system for UI updates across components

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Remove herding game from card rotation temporarily
2. Integrate EconomyManager with QuizModal for rewards/penalties
3. Implement strike system for wrong answers
4. Fix answer feedback timing (1-1.5 sec pause)

### Medium Priority
1. Add TODO comments for localStorage â†’ server migration
2. Create backend API endpoints for economy
3. Implement energy regeneration system
4. Add authentication beyond Google Sign-In

### Deployment Notes
- Both `/src` and `/kawaii-quiz-app/src` directories need updates
- Path differences: `./src/images/` vs `../src/images/`
- Service worker and PWA features ready for deployment
