Subject: Re: 来自 p0qp0q.com 的朋友 - 关于 POQPOQ.COM

Hi Tomas,

After giving this careful thought, I'm ready to move forward with your price of $2,399. You've been a thoughtful steward of POQPOQ.COM for 12 years, and your understanding of its value to JazzyPop makes this feel like the right time for the domain to find its purpose.

I genuinely appreciate how you've approached this negotiation - with both business sense and heart. Knowing that you support what we're building with JazzyPop makes this transaction feel less like a purchase and more like passing a torch.

I'm ready to proceed through GoDaddy whenever you're set to initiate the transfer. This will finally solve the p0qp0q vs poqpoq confusion and give our project the clean, memorable identity it deserves.

Thank you for being open to this conversation and for recognizing that POQPOQ belongs with a project that will bring it to life. After 8 years of admiring this domain from afar, I'm thrilled to finally give it a proper home.

Looking forward to completing the transfer and keeping you updated on JazzyPop's journey!

Warm regards,
Allen

P.S. - I'll make sure to send you a link once POQPOQ.COM is live with JazzyPop. It's going to be beautiful to see those six letters finally doing what they were meant to do - making kids smile while they learn!
