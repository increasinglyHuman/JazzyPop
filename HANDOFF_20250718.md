# JazzyPop Handoff - July 18, 2025

## Today's Accomplishments

### 1. COPPA Compliance ‚úÖ
- Fixed critical Google OAuth bypass where users could skip age verification
- Backend now returns `needs_age_verification` flag
- Frontend shows age modal for Google users without birthdate
- Tested and verified working in production

### 2. Profile System ‚úÖ
- Created ProfileEditModal for nickname/avatar editing
- Integrated with new user flow (register ‚Üí age verify ‚Üí profile setup)
- Added "Edit Profile" button in Settings for authenticated users
- Clean avatar grid UI with visual selection
- Deployed to production

### 3. Infrastructure ‚úÖ

- Sent acceptance email to Tomas for poqpoq.com ($2,399)
- Waiting for response (he's in China, expect reply tonight)

## EVENING SESSION ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### 5. MASSIVE Database Cleanup ‚úÖ
- **Fixed 698 Partial Quiz Packs!**
  - Problem: 698 quiz sets had < 10 questions each
  - Created intelligent rebalancer that combined questions by category/mode
  - Result: ZERO partial packs remaining! All 4,557 sets now have exactly 10 questions
  - Files: `fix_quiz_sets_final.py`, `quiz_pack_rebalancer.py`

### 6. AI Quiz Validator ‚úÖ
- Implemented Claude Haiku-powered validation (budget-friendly!)
- Successfully validates for factual accuracy, ambiguity, age-appropriateness
- Test run: 100 questions validated, only 1% error rate
- Files: `ai_quiz_validator.py`, `run_validation_batch.py`

### 7. CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED üö®
- **Quiz Generator Creating Opinion Questions**
  - Example: "What's the silliest thing on the Moon?" (no factual answer)
  - Same question repeated 4x in one set with different "correct" answers
  - This is happening NOW with current generator v3.0 (from July 15)
  - Created detection tools: `find_opinion_questions.py`, `factual_validation_prompts.py`

## Priority Tasks for Next Session

### URGENT - Fix Quiz Generation:
1. **Update Quiz Generators** - Add strict "factual questions only" rules
2. **Add Duplicate Detection** - Prevent same question appearing multiple times
3. **Run Full Validation** - Find all opinion/duplicate questions in database
4. **Create Cleanup Tools** - Convert opinion questions to factual ones

### High Priority (from earlier):
1. **Profile Image Selection** - Current avatar grid needs better UX
2. **First-Use Age Verification** - Anonymous visitors need age check on arrival
3. **Deck Healing System** - Auto-rebuild partial decks when questions removed
4. **Validation Overhaul**:
   - Fix questions that are too long
   - Fix unanswerable/abstract questions
   - NOW ALSO: Fix opinion-based questions

### Medium Priority:
- Fix Say What challenge mode (returning Fibonacci instead of word sequence)
- Fix trombone audio playback
- Make modals scrollable on mobile (when content exceeds screen)
- Implement "Visitor XXXX" naming for anonymous users

### Low Priority:
- Rename monitors in NOC with friendly names
- Update admin guide with NOC terminology

## Key Commands

```bash
# Check quiz stats
ssh -i ~/.ssh/poqpoq2025.pem ubuntu@p0qp0q.com
cd ~/jazzypop-backend
venv/bin/python check_final_stats.py

# Run AI validation
venv/bin/python run_validation_batch.py 50

# Find opinion questions
venv/bin/python find_opinion_questions.py

# If needed - rebalance packs
venv/bin/python fix_quiz_sets_final.py
```

## Critical Notes:
- **Quiz generator is STILL creating bad questions as of 3 days ago**
- Opinion questions have NO educational value - must fix ASAP
- Database is clean of partial packs but contains opinion/duplicate questions
- Anthropic API key is on server, using Haiku for validation
- MonkeyBot is running and reporting to Discord

## Database Stats:
- Total quiz sets: 4,557 (ALL have exactly 10 questions now!)
- Total questions: ~45,570
- Partial packs: 0 (was 698)
- Opinion questions: Unknown % (needs full scan)
- Error rate in sample: 1%

## Test Accounts:
- poqpoqBanana@gmail.com - Used for age verification testing
- Carter Zane (c4rt3rz4n3@gmail.com) - Test account

Great progress today! The database is much cleaner, but we MUST fix the generator to stop creating opinion questions. üéØ
