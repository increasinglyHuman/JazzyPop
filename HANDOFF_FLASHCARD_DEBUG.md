# JazzyPop Flashcard Debug Session Handoff

## Session Summary
Fixed flashcard input disappearing bug and deployed backend API enhancements.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Backend Deployment ✅
- Deployed new API endpoints to production server
- Added `/api/content/quote/current` endpoint
- Updated `/api/flashcards` to support dynamic content generation
- Added generators: `quote_generator.py`, `pun_generator.py`, `trivia_generator.py`
- Backend API running on port 8000 with Apache proxy

### 2. Frontend Flashcard Fix ✅
- **Root cause**: `flashcard-modal-enhanced.css` was causing input elements to disappear
- **Solution**: Broke the CSS filename in index.html to "flashcard-heck no modal-enhanced.css"
- This prevents the problematic CSS from loading
- Deployed to production at `/var/www/html/jazzypop/`

### 3. Current Status
- Backend API: ✅ Running (`uvicorn main:app` on port 8000)
- Quiz Generator: ✅ Running
- Apache: ✅ Running and proxying /api/* to backend
- Redis: ✅ Empty (no locks)

## Current Issue: Dashboard Cards

### Problem
The cards API (`/api/cards/active`) returns only a fallback card that lacks required fields:
```json
{
  "cards": [{
    "id": "...",
    "type": "quiz_tease",
    "data": {
      "title": "Quiz System Starting Up...",
      "description": "New quizzes coming soon!",
      "icon": "⏳"
      // Missing: category, difficulty
    }
  }]
}
```

### Error
`Failed to fetch cards from backend: TypeError: category is undefined`
- Location: `CardManager.js:416` expects `data.category`
- The fallback card doesn't have category/difficulty fields

### Diagnosis
1. Quiz data EXISTS and has categories ✅
2. But promotional cards are NOT being created
3. The `get_active_cards` function returns a hardcoded fallback
4. Quiz generator may not be creating promotional cards

## To Test Flashcard Fix
1. Navigate to https://p0qp0q.com/jazzypop/
2. Click "Practice with Flashcards" button
3. Verify:
   - No red background overlay
   - Cards flip properly (front → back → feedback → front of next)
   - Input fields don't disappear after flip
   - No double flip animation

## Server Access
- SSH: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/poqpoq2025.pem ubuntu@p0qp0q.com`
- Backend dir: `/home/ubuntu/jazzypop-backend`
- Frontend dir: `/var/www/html/jazzypop`
- API logs: `tail -f /home/ubuntu/jazzypop-backend/api.log`

## Next Steps
1. Test flashcard functionality
2. Fix cards API to return proper promotional cards with all required fields
3. OR: Make frontend handle missing category/difficulty gracefully
4. Ensure quiz_generator creates promotional cards when generating quizzes
