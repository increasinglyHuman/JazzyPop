# Economy System Updates

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. EconomyManager Enhanced
- Added localStorage availability check with graceful fallback to memory storage
- Implemented storage warning for users without localStorage (iframe contexts)
- Added centralized methods for all economy operations:
  - `updateXP()` - Handles XP and level progression
  - `updateHearts()` - Manages hearts with game over detection
  - `updateStreak()` - Tracks daily streaks
  - `awardRewards()` - Handles multiple rewards with heart overflow to diamonds
  - `calculateCardCost()` - Dynamic card cost based on user level

### 2. QuizModal.js Refactored
- Removed all direct DOM manipulation of economy elements
- Removed direct localStorage access for economy data
- Now uses EconomyManager for all economy operations
- Removed duplicate animation and UI methods (now in EconomyManager)

### 3. ScoringEngine.js Updated
- Converted to wrapper around EconomyManager
- Maintains backward compatibility
- No longer directly accesses localStorage

### 4. HerdingGame.js Updated
- Uses EconomyManager for rewards
- Storage operations go through EconomyManager's storage backend
- Graceful handling when localStorage unavailable

### 5. Initial Values Adjusted
- Starting energy: 50 (was 100)
- Card base cost: 2 energy (scales with level)
  - Level 1-5: 2 energy per card
  - Level 6-10: 3 energy per card
  - Level 11-15: 4 energy per card
  - etc.

## Production Considerations

### 1. Dynamic Card Costs from Backend
Currently hardcoded values need to be replaced with backend data:
- Card energy costs should come from API
- Reward amounts should be configurable
- Energy regeneration rates should be server-controlled

### 2. Progress Endpoint Design
Suggested endpoint structure:
```
POST /api/progress
{
  "session_token": "anonymous-session-id",
  "updates": {
    "xp": 50,
    "hearts": -1,
    "diamonds": 2
  },
  "source": "quiz_complete"
}

Response:
{
  "current_state": {
    "energy": 48,
    "hearts": 4,
    "diamonds": 2,
    "xp": 150,
    "level": 2
  },
  "next_regen": "2024-01-10T12:00:00Z",
  "account_benefits": {
    "saves_progress": true,
    "bonus_energy": 10,
    "exclusive_content": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Session Management for Anonymous Users
- Generate session tokens for anonymous users
- Store progress temporarily (24-48 hour expiry)
- Show periodic reminders about account benefits
- Offer easy migration of anonymous progress to account

### 4. Graceful Degradation Strategy
1. Try localStorage first
2. Fall back to sessionStorage
3. Fall back to memory storage
4. Always sync with server as source of truth
5. Show appropriate messaging based on storage availability

## Testing Scenarios

### Test No-LocalStorage:
```javascript
// In console:
delete window.localStorage;
// Or test in iframe with restricted storage
```

### Test Economy Flow:
1. Play quiz → earn XP → check level up
2. Get wrong answer → lose heart → check game over at 0
3. Complete herding game → check diamond rewards
4. Check daily streak updates

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Create /api/progress endpoint
   - Add session token generation
   - Implement temporary storage for anonymous users

2. **Dynamic Content**:
   - Add card cost field to API responses
   - Make reward amounts configurable
   - Add energy regeneration timer endpoint

3. **User Experience**:
   - Add smooth transitions for economy updates
   - Create reward celebration animations
   - Add progress loss warning when not signed in

4. **Security**:
   - Implement rate limiting on progress endpoint
   - Add validation for reasonable value changes
   - Log suspicious activity patterns
