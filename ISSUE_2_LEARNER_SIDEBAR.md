# Issue #2: Learner Sidebar Extension Loading

## Summary
The Kawaii Quiz app successfully initializes and renders when loaded as a learner sidebar extension, but the UI disappears shortly after rendering. The application works perfectly when accessed directly or as an instructor extension.

## Environment
- **Platform**: Adobe Learning Manager (ALM)
- **Extension Type**: Native Extension - Learner Sidebar
- **App Version**: 4.8
- **Browser**: Firefox 139.0.4 (confirmed on multiple browsers)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure native extension in ALM for learner sidebar with URL: `https://p0qp0q.com/kawaii-quiz/?authToken={{authToken}}`
2. Log in as a learner
3. Access the extension from the sidebar
4. Observe the app briefly appears then disappears

## Expected Behavior
The Quiz Hub interface should remain visible and interactive, showing daily challenges and quiz options.

## Actual Behavior
1. App loads and initializes successfully
2. Quiz Hub UI renders briefly (confirmed via console logs)
3. UI disappears after ~1 second
4. No JavaScript errors in console
5. ALM appears to reload the iframe 3-4 times

## Technical Details

### Console Output
```javascript
üöÄ KAWAII QUIZ INIT STARTING...
Context: { userId: "27023", courseId: null, userRole: "learner" }
üéÆ Loading QUIZ HUB for learner (no courseId)
üéâ SHOWING UNIVERSAL QUIZ HUB!
Today's theme: { category: "wisdom", icon: "üß†", title: "Wisdom Wednesday" }
‚úÖ INIT COMPLETE
// Above sequence repeats 3-4 times
```

### Key Observations
- Direct URL access works: `https://p0qp0q.com/kawaii-quiz/?authToken=natext_...`
- Console warning: "Partitioned cookie or storage access was provided"
- No course context provided to sidebar extensions
- Multiple iframe reloads initiated by ALM

## Attempted Solutions
1. ‚úÖ Added initialization guard to prevent multiple instances
2. ‚úÖ Wrapped localStorage access in try/catch blocks
3. ‚úÖ Removed all delays in rendering
4. ‚úÖ Simplified URL parameters
5. ‚ùå Issue persists despite code executing successfully

## Working Scenarios
- ‚úÖ Direct browser access to the quiz URL
- ‚úÖ Instructor extensions within courses
- ‚úÖ All functionality when tested outside ALM iframe

## Questions for Investigation
1. Are there different iframe sandboxing policies for learner sidebar extensions?
2. Is there a specific lifecycle or keepalive mechanism required?
3. Are there restrictions on DOM manipulation in sidebar contexts?
4. Is the multiple reload behavior expected for sidebar extensions?

## Impact
This prevents learners from accessing the Quiz Hub feature from the sidebar, limiting the app's availability to course-specific contexts only.
