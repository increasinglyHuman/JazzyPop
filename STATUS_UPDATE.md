# Project Status Update - December 2024

## üéØ Current Status

The Kawaii Quiz App has evolved significantly and now includes innovative features for both instructors and learners. We're currently investigating an iframe loading issue specific to learner sidebar extensions.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- **Instructor Mode**: Full quiz creation and editing capabilities
- **Learner Mode**: Interactive quiz-taking experience with scoring
- **AI Integration**: Automatic question generation using Claude AI
- **OAuth Authentication**: Secure integration with ALM using OAuth 2.0

### Recent Innovations
- **Quiz Hub**: A new mode that works without course context, perfect for sidebar placement
- **Daily Challenges**: Themed quizzes that rotate daily (Tech Tuesday, Wisdom Wednesday, etc.)
- **Universal Quizzes**: Fallback content when no course-specific quizzes are available
- **Personalization**: Integration with user profiles for customized quiz experiences

## üîç Current Investigation

### Learner Sidebar Extension Behavior
We've discovered that while the app works perfectly when accessed directly, it experiences issues when loaded as a learner sidebar extension in ALM:

1. **Direct Access**: ‚úÖ Works perfectly at `https://p0qp0q.com/kawaii-quiz/`
2. **Instructor Extensions**: ‚úÖ Functions correctly within courses
3. **Learner Sidebar**: ‚ö†Ô∏è App initializes but UI disappears after rendering

### Technical Observations
- The application code executes successfully (confirmed via console logs)
- The Quiz Hub UI renders briefly before disappearing
- ALM appears to reload the iframe multiple times (3-4 reload cycles observed)
- No JavaScript errors are thrown during execution

### Potential Factors
- Third-party iframe restrictions in learner context
- Different sandboxing policies for sidebar extensions
- Possible conflicts with ALM's iframe management
- Storage partitioning in cross-origin contexts

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Collaborating with ALM Engineering**: We're reaching out to Adobe's technical team for insights on:
   - Best practices for sidebar extensions
   - Iframe lifecycle management in ALM
   - Any specific requirements for learner extensions

2. **Alternative Approaches**: 
   - Exploring badge system integration
   - Investigating different invocation points
   - Considering lightweight alternatives for sidebar placement

## üí° Innovation Highlight

The Quiz Hub approach transforms a limitation (no course context in sidebar) into a feature - providing value to learners regardless of their current course enrollment. This includes:
- Daily themed challenges
- Skill-based personalization
- Progress tracking with streaks
- Universal knowledge quizzes
