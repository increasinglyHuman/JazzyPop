# JazzyPop Fixes Handoff - January 4, 2025

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive fixes for economy integration, UI polish, and performance improvements.

## Key Fixes Completed

### 1. **Economy Integration**
- ✅ Backend now sends economics data (costs/rewards) with quiz sets
- ✅ Frontend displays cost/reward information on cards
- ✅ Stats bar updates in real-time after gameplay
- ✅ Card costs refresh to show current resource levels (e.g., "15/85" after spending)

### 2. **Modal Launch Issues**
- ✅ Fixed practice button clicks not launching flashcard modal
- ✅ Fixed quiz card clicks not launching quiz modal
- ✅ Root cause: `handleAction` was passing wrong parameter structure

### 3. **Score Calculation**
- ✅ Fixed quiz results always showing "0/0"
- ✅ Added `correctAnswers++` tracking in `trackAnswer()` method

### 4. **UI Improvements**
- ✅ **Rewards Banner**: Doubled height (24px padding) and icon size (32px)
- ✅ **Event Badges**: 
  - Moved further right (negative margin -10px desktop, -5px mobile)
  - Only show on every 5th card to reduce clutter
  - Thicker borders (4px)
  - Bright orange-red gradients
  - Jiggle animation instead of spin
- ✅ **Speed Mode**: Difficulty tag changed from yellow to orange
- ✅ **Gem Display**: Hidden when 0, fractional values round up

### 5. **Performance**
- ✅ Reduced dashboard refresh: 30s → 2 minutes
- ✅ Reduced economy sync: 30s → 90s
- ✅ Reduced heartbeat: 5s → 30s
- ✅ Fixed infinite loop in event checking
- ✅ Slowed Zen mode animations (water: 8s→20s, breathing: 4s→8s)

### 6. **Special Events System**
Created time-based event system with:
- **Happy Hour**: 3-4 PM & 7-8 PM daily (50% off)
- **Weekend Boost**: Friday 5PM - Sunday (2x XP)
- **Day Events**: Monday (energy), Wednesday (gems), Friday (free play)
- **Holidays**: New Year's, Valentine's, April Fools, etc.

Test events manually with:
```javascript
window.economyManager.triggerSpecialEvent('half-off')
window.economyManager.triggerSpecialEvent('free-play')
window.economyManager.triggerSpecialEvent('double-xp')
window.economyManager.triggerSpecialEvent('triple-gems')
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **Backend**:
   - `/home/ubuntu/jazzypop-backend/main.py` - Added economics calculation

2. **Frontend Components**:
   - `CardManager.js` - Fixed card creation, reduced refresh rate
   - `EconomyManager.js` - Added event system, fixed infinite loop
   - `GenericCardEnhanced.js` - Fixed action handling, gem display
