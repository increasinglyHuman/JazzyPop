# Session Handoff - January 8, 2025

## Summary
Implemented complete email/password authentication system for JazzyPop, from backend to frontend to email service setup.

## Major Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Backend Authentication
- Created `/api/auth/register` endpoint
- Created `/api/auth/login` endpoint  
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session migration support
- Email validation
- All endpoints tested and working

### ‚úÖ Frontend Authentication UI
- Enhanced profile panel with login/register forms
- Added password reset form (ready for Phase 2)
- Created AuthPanel.js component
- Added logout functionality
- Integrated with existing design

### ‚úÖ AWS SES Email Service
- Domain verified (p0qp0q.com)
- DKIM records configured
- DMARC policy added
- SMTP credentials created
- Backend .env configured
- Production access requested (24hr wait)

## Current Bug to Fix

### üêõ Input Fields Not Clickable
**Problem**: Registration form inputs are not editable/clickable
**Cause**: The `authMessage` div has `display: block` and is overlapping the input fields
**Solution**: 
1. Check why authMessage is showing by default
2. Should be `display: none` unless there's a message
3. Likely issue in AuthPanel.js `showMessage()` or initialization

**Quick fix**: 
```javascript
document.getElementById('authMessage').style.display = 'none';
```

## File Locations

### Local Files Modified:
- `/frontend/index.html` (backup created)
- `/frontend/src/scripts/dashboard.js` (backup created)
- `/frontend/src/components/AuthPanel.js` (NEW)
- `/frontend/src/styles/components/profile-selector.css`
- `/backend/main.py`
- `/backend/auth_utils.py` (NEW)

### Deployment Status:
- ‚úÖ Backend deployed and running
- ‚ùå Frontend CSS needs deployment to server
- ‚úÖ SMTP credentials in server .env

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Bug Fix):
1. Fix authMessage div blocking inputs
2. Deploy CSS changes to server
3. Test full registration flow

### Phase 2 Ready (After SES Approval):
- Password reset endpoints
- Email sending implementation
- Reset email templates

### Waiting On:
- AWS SES production approval (requested Jan 8, ~24hrs)
- Then password reset emails will work

## Testing Credentials
- Test registration works with real email domains
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number
- Session migration tested and working

## Important Notes
- Email validator checks if domains accept mail (example.com fails)
- Users can login/register NOW - only password reset needs email service
- Frontend shows logged-in state after auth
- Google OAuth still works alongside email/password

## Context Usage
Started: Full context
Ended: ~5% remaining
Main work completed despite invisible div bug at the end! üòÑ
