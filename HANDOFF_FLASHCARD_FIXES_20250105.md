# Flashcard System Fixes - January 5, 2025

## Session Summary
Collaborative debugging session to fix practice card buttons and economy integration issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Profile Bot Image Paths ✅
**Problem**: Images returning 404 due to incorrect relative paths
**Solution**: Changed all image paths from `../src/images/` to `./src/images/`
**Files Modified**:
- `/frontend/src/scripts/dashboard.js`
- `/frontend/src/components/profile/AvatarSelector.js`
- `/frontend/src/components/EconomyManager.js`
- `/frontend/src/components/QuizModal.js`

### 2. Economy Manager Undefined Error ✅
**Problem**: `updateDashboardDisplay` receiving undefined economyData
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `economyUpdated` event to include detail data
- Added null checks in dashboard.js
**Files Modified**:
- `/frontend/src/components/EconomyManager.js` (line 672)
- `/frontend/src/scripts/dashboard.js` (lines 1214, 1330)

### 3. Flashcard Modal Not Displaying ✅
**Problem**: Modal was activating but not visible (scroll was blocked but no visual)
**Solution**: Added `!important` CSS overrides to force display
**Files Modified**:
- `/frontend/src/styles/components/flashcard-modal.css`
  - Added `!important` to `.flashcard-modal` position, dimensions, and z-index
  - Added `!important` to `.flashcard-modal.active` display property

## Working Features
- ✅ Practice card buttons trigger flashcard modal
- ✅ Economy system checks energy before starting
- ✅ Flashcards fetch from API successfully
- ✅ Modal displays with backdrop blur
- ✅ Rewards process on completion
- ✅ Energy spend request sent to backend

## Outstanding Issue - Backend Energy Deduction

### Problem
Flashcards don't deduct energy properly:
- Frontend sends: `spendEnergy(1, 'flashcard_start')`
- Backend responds: `success: true, newValue: 100` (should be 99)
- Energy stays at 100 instead of decreasing to 99

### Current Implementation
Both quiz and flashcard use the same pattern:
```javascript
// Quiz Modal
await window.economyManager.spendEnergy(10, 'quiz_start');

// Flashcard Modal  
await window.economyManager.spendEnergy(1, 'flashcard_start');
```

Both hit `/api/economy/process-result` endpoint with:
```json
{
  "type": "flashcard_start",  // or "quiz_start"
  "session_id": "...",
  "user_id": "..."
}
```

### Issue Analysis
- Quiz energy deduction works (100 → 90)
- Flashcard energy deduction fails (100 → 100)
- Backend's `process-result` endpoint handles "quiz_start" but not "flashcard_start"

## Recommended Backend Fix

### Option 1: Add flashcard_start handling
Update `/api/economy/process-result` to recognize and handle:
- `type: "flashcard_start"` → deduct 1 energy
- Similar to how it handles `type: "quiz_start"` → deduct 10 energy

### Option 2: Create dedicated spend endpoint (Preferred)
Add new endpoint `/api/economy/spend`:
```
POST /api/economy/spend
{
  "resource": "energy",
  "amount": 1,
  "reason": "flashcard_start"
}
```

This would be cleaner than overloading the game results endpoint for simple resource spending.

## Testing Notes
- First practice of the day gives 1.5x XP (not free energy)
- Energy should decrease: 100 → 99 for flashcards, 100 → 90 for quizzes
- Test with less than max energy to verify deduction
- Check rewards popup after completing flashcard sets

## Next Steps
1. Backend team needs to implement energy deduction for flashcard_start
2. Consider adding dedicated spend endpoint for cleaner API design
3. Test energy deduction with various starting energy levels
4. Verify rewards calculation for flashcard completion
