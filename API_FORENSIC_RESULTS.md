# JazzyPop API Forensic Investigation Results

## Problem Solved ✅

### Issue
- Frontend was configured to use `https://p0qp0q.com/api/*`
- API calls were failing with 500 Internal Server Error
- Backend was accessible via direct IP but not domain

### Root Cause
1. **Apache proxy was configured correctly** - routing `/api/*` to backend on port 8000
2. **Redis references in database.py** - The deployed code still had Redis calls even though Redis was disabled
3. When API calls hit `get_current_quiz()`, it tried to access `self.redis.get()` on a None object

### Solution Applied
1. Deployed the Redis-free version of database.py from local codebase
2. Restarted the jazzypop-backend service
3. API now working correctly through the domain

### Verified Working Endpoints
- ✅ `https://p0qp0q.com/api/content/quiz/current`
- ✅ `https://p0qp0q.com/api/cards/active`
- ✅ `https://p0qp0q.com/api/content/quiz/sets`
- ✅ All other `/api/*` endpoints

## Remaining Cleanup Tasks

1. **Remove all Redis references** from:
   - Other database methods that still reference Redis
   - Configuration files (.env)
   - Import statements

2. **Remove IP address references** in frontend code:
   - Some components still have fallback to `http://52.88.234.65:8000`
   - Should only use `https://p0qp0q.com`

3. **Monitor for any other Redis-related errors** in:
   - Leaderboard functions
   - Card caching
   - Flashcard content caching
