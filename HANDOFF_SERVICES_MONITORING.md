# Services & Monitoring Handoff

## Current Status

### Economy Deployment ‚úÖ
- Successfully deployed all economy integration files
- Frontend: Dashboard sync, energy checks, rewards popup working
- Backend: API running on port 8000, economy endpoints active
- Virtual environment recreated with all dependencies

### Services Status ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **jazzypop-api.service** - Running ‚úÖ
2. **jazzypop-backend.service** - Failing (947+ restarts) ‚ùå
3. **jazzypop-generators.service** - Failing ‚ùå
4. **jazzypop-monitor.service** - Running but not sending webhooks ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Issues Found

#### 1. Services Not Auto-Restarting Properly
- Services hit StartLimitBurst (5) and stopped trying
- Backend service has 947+ restart attempts
- Need to identify root cause of failures

#### 2. Monitor Not Sending Discord Webhooks
- Monitor script is running
- Looking for webhook URL in environment variables
- `.env` file exists but webhook might not be configured
- Permission error on `start_all_set_generators.sh` (fixed with chmod +x)

#### 3. Virtual Environment Issue
- Services were failing with status=203/EXEC
- Fixed by recreating venv with all dependencies
- Created DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md in backend folder

### Next Steps

1. **Fix failing services:**
   ```bash
   # Check actual error
   sudo journalctl -u jazzypop-backend -n 50
   
   # Reset and restart
   sudo systemctl reset-failed jazzypop-backend
   sudo systemctl restart jazzypop-backend
   ```

2. **Configure Discord webhook:**
   - Check `.env` file for DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
   - Or create `.discord_webhook` file with URL
   - Restart monitor service

3. **Debug generators service:**
   - Check if it needs the venv too
   - Verify all scripts are executable

### SSH Access Note
- SSH was broken after reboot
- Fixed by resetting key through AWS console
- Now restricted to your IP only for security
- Server disk is 94.8% full - might need cleanup

### Files Modified Today
- Frontend: index.html, EconomyManager.js, QuizModal.js, FlashcardModal.js, CardManager.js, dashboard.js
- Backend: main.py, database.py
- New: RewardsPopup.js, rewards-popup.css, DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md

Good luck with the next session! üöÄ
