# JazzyPop Project Handoff - DJ Claud3 ðŸŽµ

## Current Status (December 2024)
The Kawaii Quiz App v4.8 is deployed and operational. We've prepared comprehensive GitHub documentation for ALM engineering review regarding the learner sidebar extension issue.

## Recent Accomplishments
1. **GitHub Repository "JazzyPop" Created**
   - Professional README with vibrant hero image
   - Comprehensive STATUS_UPDATE.md for engineers
   - Detailed COST_ANALYSIS.md ($1.18 per 1,000 quizzes)
   - Technical investigation in ISSUE_2_LEARNER_SIDEBAR.md
   - GitHub Issue #2 created for learner sidebar problem

2. **Quiz Hub Innovation**
   - Works without course context (perfect for sidebar)
   - Daily themed challenges
   - Universal quiz fallback
   - Multiple initialization guard implemented

3. **Documentation Quality**
   - Added professional hero art
   - Cost projections with enterprise scenarios
   - Clear technical issue documentation
   - Ready for engineering review

## Active Investigation
**Learner Sidebar Extension Issue**
- App loads but UI disappears after ~1 second
- ALM reloads iframe 3-4 times
- No JavaScript errors
- Awaiting response from 17 ALM engineers contacted

## Key Directories
- **Frontend**: `/home/ubuntu/kawaii-quiz-deploy/kawaii-quiz-app/`
- **Backend**: `/home/p0qp0q/Documents/Merlin/kawaii-quiz-backend/`
- **GitHub Repo**: `/home/p0qp0q/Documents/Merlin/JazzyPop/`

## Important Context
- OAuth works for both instructor and learner roles
- Direct URL access works perfectly
- Instructor extensions work fine
- Only learner sidebar has issues
- v4.8 includes all latest fixes

## Next Steps
1. Monitor GitHub traffic for engineer visits
2. Await ALM team response on Issue #2
3. Potential badge system integration
4. Consider alternative sidebar approaches

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Vanilla JS with kawaii aesthetics
- Backend: Node.js/Express with Claude AI
- Auth: OAuth 2.0 with role-based credentials
- AI: Claude Haiku for quiz generation

## Recent Discoveries
- ALM passes `authToken` not `access_token`
- Native tokens (`natext_`) can't use public API
- Third-party iframe storage partitioning affects sidebar
- Multiple iframe reloads may be ALM behavior

## Fun Note
DJ Claud3 now in the credits - keeping it jazzy! ðŸŽ§
