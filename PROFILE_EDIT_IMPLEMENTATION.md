# Profile Edit Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a ProfileEditModal component that provides a clean interface for users to edit their nickname and avatar. The modal appears:
1. After new user registration/login (following age verification)
2. When existing users click "Edit Profile" in settings

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/frontend/src/components/ProfileEditModal.js` - Main modal component
- `/frontend/src/styles/components/profile-edit-modal.css` - Modal styling

### Modified Files:
- `/frontend/index.html` - Added CSS and JS includes
- `/frontend/src/components/AuthPanel.js` - Shows profile modal for new users
- `/frontend/src/components/SettingsPanel.js` - Added Edit Profile button

## User Flow

### New User Registration:
1. User signs up (email or Google)
2. Age verification modal appears
3. After age verification â†’ **Profile Setup Modal**
4. User enters nickname and selects avatar
5. Clicks "Start Playing!"

### Existing User Edit:
1. User opens Settings
2. Sees "Account" section (only when authenticated)
3. Clicks "Edit Profile"
4. Modal opens with current nickname/avatar
5. User makes changes and saves

## Features

### ProfileEditModal:
- **Nickname validation**: 3-20 characters
- **Inappropriate content filter**: Blocks "admin", "mod", "staff", "jazzypop"
- **Avatar grid**: 8 avatar options with visual selection

- **Success feedback**: Updates UI immediately after save

### Visual Design:
- Dark theme with green accents (matches JazzyPop style)

## Next Steps

- Disable profile editing for visitors

### Additional Features:

- Nickname change cooldown/limits
- Profile badges/achievements display
- Social features (view other players' profiles)
